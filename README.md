Karaoke Video Player

This was my weekend project to learn a little GUI programming with Tkinter.

Good site for tagging "mood", "genre", "decade": https://rateyourmusic.com/

Directory structure expected inside KARAOKE_DIR/:
by-artist-first/[a-z]
by-artist-last/[a-z]
by-decade/{1920,1930,1940,...}
by-genre/{country,rock,...}
by-mood/{dance,musical,...}
by-title/[0-9a-z]
